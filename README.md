# Functions developed

- [harvesine distance](haversine_distance.py) - To calculate distance between two points in a sphere given their longitudes and latitudes
- [Levenshtein distance](levenshtein_dist.py) - Levenshtein distance is a string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences. In simple words, it is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other

- [Rock-Paper-Scissors](Rock_Paper_Scissors.py) - The very famous Rock-Paper-Scissors terminal game

- [NumberChain](NumberChain.py) 
    Ask the user "How many numbers?", then print out a chain of ascending numbers, starting at 0. After the results have printed ask the user if they would like to continue.If "y", restart the process, starting at 0 again. If "n", exit the chain.
Rather than just displaying numbers constantly starting at 0, have the numbers begin at the end of the previous chain.
